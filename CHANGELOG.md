## 1.0.1 (Unreleased)

BUGS FIXED:

* Normalize IP addresses before comparing them, so non-canonical forms don't cause errant diffs [GH-13]
* Properly handle IPv6 IP addresses as the update host. Previously this would create an invalid connection address due to not properly constructing the address format. [GH-22]

## 1.0.0 (September 15, 2017)

* No changes from 0.1.1; just adjusting to [the new version numbering scheme](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-terraform-provider-versioning/).

## 0.1.1 (August 28, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* **`dns_aaaa_record_set` data source** for fetching IPv6 address records ([#9](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/9))
* **`dns_ns_record_set` data source** for fetching nameserver records ([#10](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/10))
* **`dns_ns_record_set` resource** for creating new nameserver records via the DNS update protocol ([#10](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/10))

## 0.1.0 (June 20, 2017)

NOTES:

* Same functionality as that of Terraform 0.9.8. Repacked as part of [Provider Splitout](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/)
