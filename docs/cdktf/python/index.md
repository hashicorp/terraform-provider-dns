  The DNS provider supports DNS updates (RFC 2136). Additionally, the provider can be configured with secret key based transaction authentication (RFC 2845) or can use GSS-TSIG (RFC 3645).

# DNS Provider

The DNS provider supports resources that perform DNS updates ([RFC 2136](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2136)) and data sources for reading DNS information. The provider can be configured with secret key based transaction authentication ([RFC 2845](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2845)) or GSS-TSIG ([RFC 3645](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3645)).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

Using secret key based transaction authentication (RFC 2845):

from imports.dns.a_record_set import ARecordSet
from imports.dns.provider import DnsProvider
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, addresses, zone):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DnsProvider(self, "dns",
            update=[DnsProviderUpdate(
                key_algorithm="hmac-md5",
                key_name="example.com.",
                key_secret="3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=",
                server="192.168.0.1"
            )
            ]
        )
        ARecordSet(self, "www",
            addresses=addresses,
            zone=zone
        )
```

Using GSS-TSIG (RFC 3645):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.dns.a_record_set import ARecordSet
from imports.dns.provider import DnsProvider
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, addresses, zone):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DnsProvider(self, "dns",
            update=[DnsProviderUpdate(
                gssapi=[DnsProviderUpdateGssapi(
                    keytab="/path/to/keytab",
                    realm="EXAMPLE.COM",
                    username="user"
                )
                ],
                server="ns.example.com"
            )
            ]
        )
        ARecordSet(self, "www",
            addresses=addresses,
            zone=zone
        )
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `update` (Block List) When the provider is used for DNS updates, this block is required. Only one `update` block may be in the configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--update))

<a id="nestedblock--update"></a>
### Nested Schema for `update`

Optional:

- `gssapi` (Block List) A `gssapi` block. Only one `gssapi` block may be in the configuration. Conflicts with use of `key_name`, `key_algorithm` and `key_secret`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--update--gssapi))
- `key_algorithm` (String) Required if `key_name` is set. When using TSIG authentication, the algorithm to use for HMAC. Valid values are `hmac-md5`, `hmac-sha1`, `hmac-sha256` or `hmac-sha512`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_KEYALGORITHM environment variable.
- `key_name` (String) The name of the TSIG key used to sign the DNS update messages. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_KEYNAME environment variable.
- `key_secret` (String) Required if `key_name` is set
A Base64-encoded string containing the shared secret to be used for TSIG. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_KEYSECRET environment variable.
- `port` (Number) The target UDP port on the server where updates are sent to. Defaults to `53`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_PORT environment variable.
- `retries` (Number) How many times to retry on connection timeout. Defaults to `3`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_RETRIES environment variable.
- `server` (String) The hostname or IP address of the DNS server to send updates to. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_SERVER environment variable.
- `timeout` (String) Timeout for DNS queries. Valid values are durations expressed as `500ms`, etc. or a plain number which is treated as whole seconds. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_TIMEOUT environment variable.
- `transport` (String) Transport to use for DNS queries. Valid values are `udp`, `udp4`, `udp6`, `tcp`, `tcp4`, or `tcp6`. Any UDP transport will retry automatically with the equivalent TCP transport in the event of a truncated response. Defaults to `udp`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_TRANSPORT environment variable.

<a id="nestedblock--update--gssapi"></a>
### Nested Schema for `update.gssapi`

Optional:

- `keytab` (String) This or `password` is required if `username` is set, not supported on Windows. The path to a keytab file containing a key for `username`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_KEYTAB environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) This or `keytab` is required if `username` is set. The matching password for `username`. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `realm` (String) The Kerberos realm or Active Directory domain. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_REALM environment variable.
- `username` (String) The name of the user to authenticate as. If not set the current user session will be used. Value can also be sourced from the DNS_UPDATE_USERNAME environment variable.
